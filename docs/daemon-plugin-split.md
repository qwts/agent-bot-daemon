# Splitting agent-bot into a daemon (HQ) and plugins

**Status:** Draft for review. This is a plan only: nothing in it has been built,
and no refactor commits come with it.
**Decision owner:** Chris
**Governing spec:** *Soul Agent Platform*, whitepaper draft 0.4 (Chris Kane,
2026-10-27), called **0.4** below. This document maps 0.4 onto the agent-bot
repositories. Where the two differ, 0.4 wins unless a decision in §10 records
a deliberate departure.

## 0. Summary

- **0.4 is the target.** HQ is a trusted local host service in its own
  account. It runs admission, grants, approvals, budgets, the task and action
  ledgers, and the broker. The agent-bot server is the **identity service**:
  it holds keys, mints short-lived device-bound tokens and records each
  issuance, and never gets lifecycle or execution control. Relays route
  sealed frames and nothing else. The Soul (its entry point and members) is
  untrusted for authority.
- **The repositories map onto 0.4:**
  - **agent-bot-daemon** is HQ.
  - **agent-bot-identity** is the identity plugin inside HQ: device key,
    enrollment, credential references, grants, approvals.
  - **agent-bot-comms** provides the broker in HQ, the comms client in the
    Soul, and relay mode for the relays.
  - **agent-bot-soul-runtime** provides the package, render and admission
    logic in HQ, plus the Soul's entry point.

  Inside HQ, plugins talk only through host services and events.
- **This replaces the first version of this plan.** That version treated the
  daemon as untrusted, put approvals and policy on the server, and added
  server-to-daemon RPC over the relay. All three contradict 0.4 (R2, R3,
  §3), and §10.4 records what changed and why.
- **The soul package follows 0.4 §11:** `Example.soul/Contents/` with
  `SoulInfo.json`, `SoulLock.json`, `primitives/`, `memorial/`, `dreams/`,
  `comms/`, `home/<member>/` and `workspaces/`. Formats 1 and 2 migrate to
  it, and SOUL.md becomes the persona primitive.
- **The migration is 30 small PRs, mapped to 0.4's stages 0–4 and work
  packages WP1–WP7.** Stage 0 happens in place in `agent-bot-identity`
  behind golden tests. HQ then wraps the existing daemon (strangler) before
  taking over its authority. The `agent-bot` CLI and MCP tools keep working
  throughout.

## 1. Where we start

### 1.1 Facts

- **agent-bot-identity** has 286 runtime `.mjs` files outside `tests/`,
  `scripts/` and `tools/`. 47 of them are one-line re-export shims left by
  ADR-0645 step 6, which leaves 239 real modules and about 75.6k lines. On
  top of that come `keyd/` (Rust), `hooks/`, `web/` and the tests.
- **`governance/runtime-modules.json`** assigns each file to one of these
  modules: `identity`, `soul`, `comms`, `harness`, `org`, `shared`, `host`
  or `cli`. `tests/module-boundaries.test.mjs` enforces the import rules,
  and the published entries are `identity-host`, `identity-soul`,
  `identity-cli`, `identity-format`, `daemon-client` and
  `identity-presence`. This plan uses that map as the starting inventory,
  and it is the WP1 compatibility inventory 0.4 Appendix E asks for
  (Appendix A here).
- **Today's daemon is one process per OS user,** running in the same account
  as its souls (ADR-0332 decision 1, ENG-0339). By 0.4's definitions that is
  at best the **managed cooperative** profile, because HQ-like functions
  share a trust domain with the members. Where App keys sit in readable
  files it is closer to **standalone unenforced**. It already composes modules through injected
  ports (`createIdentityRoutes`, `createSoulRoutes` in `agent-daemon.mjs`
  around L575–589), which is the seed of the plugin contract.
- **An extraction is already approved.** `docs/identity-extraction-plan.md`
  extracts identity to `qwts/agent-identity`, and the owner answered its
  questions on 2026-10-11. This plan replaces that end state (D1).
- **The identity service exists in part** (`identity/server-client.mjs`,
  #1181, opt-in). It has:
  - RFC 8628 device enrollment;
  - a software P-256 device key in `device-key.pem`;
  - 15-minute DPoP-bound tokens;
  - Ed25519-signed responses;
  - repo-scoped installation tokens;
  - notices (`peek`, `take`, `ack`, `release`);
  - App webhooks.

  It doesn't yet bind mints to grants, keep issuance records, offer an
  owner-unlock vault, or check hardware attestation (0.4 §4, Appendix A).
  The server is moving to `agents.true-line.ai`.
- **The empty repos.** `qwts/agent-bot-daemon` now has a seeded `main`
  (PR #2's base); `qwts/agent-bot-soul-runtime` is still empty, and
  `qwts/agent-bot-comms` doesn't exist.

### 1.2 0.4 components and where they live

| 0.4 component (§3) | Trust domain | Repository here | Today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HQ | Trusted host service, outside every Soul | **agent-bot-daemon** (D1; 0.4 Appendix C names managed-machine) | `agent-daemon.mjs` and the host modules, running in each agent account |
| Broker | Same as HQ | agent-bot-comms, broker mode, loaded into HQ | agent-comms broker (owner account) |
| Relay (site, cloud) | Untrusted for content; routing only | agent-bot-comms, relay mode | None (ADR-0028 federation is policy only) |
| Installation authority (post-MVP) | Owner-operated service with its own key | Not planned here | None |
| Identity service | Remote and owner-operated; custody and issuance only | `true-line/agent-bot` (Go) | Server mode, opt-in |
| Entry point (`agent-bot soul run`) | Inside the Soul; untrusted | agent-bot-soul-runtime | Launch, ACP and cold-wake code in the daemon |
| Comms client | Inside the Soul; early validation only | agent-bot-comms, client mode | `agent-comms` CLI |
| Lead, specialist (harness adapters over ACP) | Inside the Soul | Adapter manifests in soul-runtime | `acp-engine`, `acp-registry` |
| GeniusBar, HQ CLI | Owner's authenticated session | GeniusBar; the `agent-bot` CLI from agent-bot-daemon | GeniusBar; `agent-bot` |

### 1.3 Size by destination

This is the result of the inventory in Appendix A.

| Destination | Files | Lines |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| agent-bot-soul-runtime (core, HQ side, entry point) | 98 | 30,284 |
| agent-bot-daemon (HQ core, member surfaces, CLI, SDK, org) | 63 | 22,393 |
| agent-bot-identity (plugin) | 49 | 14,773 |
| agent-bot-comms (agent-bot side) | 14 | 4,087 |
| agent-bot-comms (today's agent-comms) | 105 | 12,683 |
| Authority moves to the identity service | 9 | 2,258 |
| Deprecated | 6 | 1,848 |

## 2. Inventory and dependency map

The full per-module table is **Appendix A**. It gives each module's lines,
current module, target, 0.4 trust domain, filesystem/worktree/keyd/comms
coupling, fan-in and fan-out, cross-repo imports and cycle membership. This
section summarises it.

### 2.1 Mapping rules

| Current ADR-0645 module | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| `identity` | agent-bot-identity, loaded into HQ. The tools members run (gh shim, credential helper, git hooks) stay on the Soul side and are cooperative-profile only. Key custody, secret stores and App management go to the identity service; the inbox is deprecated. |
| `soul` | agent-bot-soul-runtime, in three parts: `core/` (pure, used on both sides), `hq/` (validation, render, admission, launch, transfer) and `entry-point/` (front door, members, recovery). |
| `comms` | agent-bot-comms: broker mode in HQ, client mode in the Soul. |
| `host`, `cli` | agent-bot-daemon. The member-facing surfaces (`agent-bot mcp`, `reach-mcp`, the hook runner) run in the Soul and only ask HQ. |
| `shared`, `harness` | `@agent-bot/sdk`, vendored by digest. Adapter manifests follow 0.4 §10. |
| `org` | agent-bot-daemon `org/`. Per-soul SOP selection goes to soul-runtime core. |

### 2.2 What couples to what

These are heuristic scans; Appendix A has the per-file flags.

- **Filesystem.** 128 of the 239 modules import `node:fs`. In ADR-0645's
  soul module, 61 of 94 do. That includes 28 of the 53 core candidates, such
  as `soul-revisions`, `soul-memory`, `agent-population` and
  `skill-library`.
- **Worktrees.**
  - Soul side: `setup-worktree`, `claude-worktree-create`,
    `soul-worktrees`, `soul-join`, `soul-home`, `soul-env*` and
    `confinement`.
  - Identity side: `agent-binding`, `resolve-agent`, `worktree-token`,
    `git-credential-bot` and `signed-commit`.

  Under 0.4 these become HQ-mediated workspace views: a task's write scope
  plus mounted views in the protected profile (§4, §7).
- **keyd.**
  - Identity: `keyd-client`, `owner-presence`, `owner-decision-trust`,
    `soul-credentials`, `identity-apps` and `vouch`.
  - Host: `keyd-supervisor`.
  - Soul: `soul-credential-migration` and `soul-secrets`.

  keyd's App-key role ends and its device-key role moves into HQ's signer.
- **comms imported from soul.** These are `cold-wake` → `comms-relay`,
  `soul-join`/`soul-fork`/`soul-remove` → `comms-membership`, `soul-comms`
  and `soul-remove` → `daemon-status`, `soul-build`/`soul-builder` →
  `reach-contract`, `cold-wake-settings` → `wake-webhook-store`, and
  `owner-action` → `owner-principal`. Each becomes a host service, an event
  or a broker message kind.
- **soul to identity goes through one door:** 15 of the 17 crossings import
  `identity/identity-soul.mjs`. That entry becomes the identity plugin's
  service object inside HQ.
- **Plugins reaching the host.** These are `keyd-supervisor` →
  `daemon-supervisor`, `delegation-grants` and `cli/soul-env-transfer` →
  `agent-jobs`, `telegram-adapter` → `agent-daemon` and `agent-interaction`,
  and `wake-plane` → `agent-jobs` and `daemon-mcp`. All of them become host
  services.

### 2.3 Wire code duplicated across repos

The SDK `wire/` folder should own these once, and 0.4 WP1 turns them into
versioned schemas:

| Code | Copies |
| --- | --- |
| Binding proof | `identity/binding-proof.mjs` = agent-comms `lib/binding-proof.mjs` (ADR-0008 amendment 1) |
| Presence verifier | `identity/presence-verifier.mjs` + `identity-presence.mjs` = agent-comms `lib/vendor/agent-bot-presence/` |
| Owner-decision journal | `identity/owner-decision-journal-frame.mjs`, `-prepared`, `-bytes` ≈ agent-comms `lib/owner-decision-*` |
| Canonical JSON | `canonical-json.mjs` in both. 0.4 §6 proposes JCS (RFC 8785) for signed structures. |
| Windows task jobs, secret store | `windows-task-job.mjs`, `secret-store.mjs` in both |

### 2.4 Cycles

There are five strongly connected components at file level, found with
Tarjan's algorithm over shim-resolved imports.

| ID | Files | Crosses | How to break it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** | 14: `identity/soul-credentials` → `soul-app-declarations` → `agent-population` → `soul-mode`/`soul-model` → `cold-wake-settings` → `identity/identity-soul` → `identity/soul-credentials`. The other members are `owner-action`, `identity-app-store`, `ensure-private-key`, `mint-token`, `git-credential-bot`, `credential-reconciler` and `agent-backfill`. | **identity ↔ soul.** This is the only `identity → soul` edge, through the `soul-app-declarations` contract. | (1) Soul-runtime registers an `appDeclarations()` provider with identity at init (inversion). (2) Under 0.4, which service identity a mint uses comes from the *grant*, not from soul declarations, so the edge disappears. (3) `ownerGate` moves out of `cold-wake-settings` into HQ approval records. |
| C2 | `agent-space` ↔ `soul-memory` | none | Both become `memorial/` storage behind the life-store port. |
| C3 | 9: `sandbox`, `sandbox-export`, `sandbox-remove`, `skill-manifest`, `sop`, `soul-comms`, `soul-env-export`, `soul-profile`, `soul-revisions` | soul ↔ org (`sop`) | Split `sop.mjs` (org resolver / soul selection). A `RevisionStore` port removes the back-edges. |
| C4 | `soul-env` ↔ `soul-env-migrate` | none | Extract the descriptor reader that both use. |
| C5 | `agent-daemon` ↔ `agent-web` ↔ `daemon-supervisor` | none (host) | A daemon `state` module. |

                 (keys, per-owner encryption, grant-bound minting, issuance records,
                  webhooks → notices; never lifecycle)
```

HQ dials out to the identity service and to relays. It accepts no inbound
network connection. The control socket and broker socket are local and
access-controlled. Remote owner administration uses a tunnel the owner opens
(SSH forwarding of the control socket in the MVP, per 0.4 §4).

### 3.1 The repositories

| Repo | Owns | Ships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **agent-bot-daemon** (HQ) | `hq/v1` control API and owner session authentication; the authoritative store; enforcement-profile detection and honest reporting (R8); member launch under protected principals; the identity-service link; the plugin host; the `agent-bot` CLI (owner commands); the member-facing surfaces (`agent-bot mcp`, `reach-mcp`, hook runner) as thin clients of HQ; readiness and doctor; install and update; the org resolver; `@agent-bot/sdk`; the WP1 contract schemas and fixtures | The HQ release: the pinned plugin set plus launchers for macOS, Windows and Linux |
| **agent-bot-identity** | Device enrollment with the identity service; the HQ signer (keyd → `agent-bot-signer`); credential references and their resolution into short-lived tokens held by HQ; grants and caller-bound grant handles; HQ approval records; Soul ID, member, runtime and installation identity; receipts and attribution (0.4's [S5] scope); the cooperative-profile member tools (gh shim, credential helper, git hooks) | Plugin package plus the signer binary |
| **agent-bot-comms** | Broker mode (in HQ): mailbox, durable inbox and outbox, directives and queries as message kinds, the task service, dedup in HQ's store, budgets and sub-allocations, brokered inference and service egress, receipts. Client mode (in the Soul): the CLI and early validation. Relay mode: site and cloud relays. Also the identity-service notices feed, the A2A edge gateway, and channel adapters (Telegram). | Plugin package, the `agent-comms` CLI, and the relay build |
| **agent-bot-soul-runtime** | Package format (0.4 §11), validator, manifest digests, `soul build` render per adapter, adapter manifests, transfer, fork and template export, dream admission and candidate workflow (HQ side); the entry point: front door, member supervision, role routing, handoff notes, recovery ladder (Soul side); the pure core both use; conformance fixtures | `core/`, `hq/` (plugin), `entry-point/` (pinned with each Soul, per 0.4 §3) |

### 3.2 Trust domains, per plugin

The domains are 0.4's:

- **HQ:** trusted, in its own account. Its key store and authority database
  are inaccessible to Soul processes.
- **Soul:** the model and tool trust domain: the entry point, members, and
  the tools they run.
- **Identity service:** remote, trusted for credential custody and issuance
  only.
- **Relay:** untrusted for content.
- **Owner client:** GeniusBar and the HQ CLI under the owner's account.

#### Daemon (HQ core)

| Piece | Domain | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hq/v1` control socket, owner sessions, lifecycle | HQ | R2: lifecycle and the admin channel end at local HQ. |
| Authoritative store: grants, spent nonces, task revisions, dedup, action ledger, budgets, approvals | HQ, inaccessible to members | 0.4 §11: a member-writable ledger can't fence a hostile member. |
| Member launch, per-member principals, profile reporting | HQ | R3, R8 |
| Identity-service link (assertions signed by the HQ signer; DPoP tokens in memory) | HQ | No long-lived secret on the host. |
| `agent-bot mcp`, `reach-mcp`, hook runner, commands members run | Soul | Thin clients. HQ repeats every check. |
| Network listeners | none | HQ dials out only. The optional browser PWA's `127.0.0.1` listener is the one exception (§7). |

#### Identity

| Piece | Domain | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device key | HQ signer (Secure Enclave or TPM, HQ account only) | Non-exportable. Revoking the device needs no key rotation. A software key is a stage 0–1 transition only, and the identity service may refuse to mint for it per policy (§4.7). |
| Enrollment | HQ, plus the owner confirming on the identity service | One-time, owner-confirmed challenge (0.4 §3). |
| GitHub App keys and other service identities | Identity service | 0.4 §4, §12 |
| Minting, issuance records | Identity service | Bound to the device and the grant. Each issuance is recorded. |
| Credential references → short-lived tokens | HQ (memory), used only by brokered adapters | Members get references, never secrets (Equip, 0.4 §5). |
| Grants, grant handles, caller binding | HQ | R3. Handles are caller-bound per runtime admission. |
| Approval records | HQ, signed, from the owner session | 0.4 §8: bound to the digest of the proposed action. |
| Soul ID, member, runtime and installation records; receipts | HQ store | R1 |
| gh shim, credential helper, git hooks | Soul, **cooperative profile only** | In the protected profile members hold no service token, and service writes go through the broker's adapter. |
| Vouch / soul-token key (today `vouch-key.pem`) | **HQ signer only**, non-exportable | No long-lived signing key as a file on the host. Secure Enclave and most TPMs hold P-256 rather than Ed25519, so soul tokens move to a `v2` signed with ES256. The agent-comms broker verifies `v2` and accepts `v1` (Ed25519) only during the transition window. If a host has no hardware signer, the identity service signs soul tokens instead, and HQ asks for them like any other credential. |

#### Comms

| Piece | Domain | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broker: mailbox, tasks, dedup, receipts, budgets, brokered egress | HQ | 0.4 §3: same trust domain as HQ. |
| Comms client and CLI | Soul | Early validation only. The broker repeats every check. |
| Site and cloud relays | Relay | Sealed inner content. They can't create grants, mint directives or wake processes. |
| Notices (GitHub webhook events) | Identity service; pulled by the broker | Arrive as provenance `external-untrusted`, so they never cold-start a Soul (§4.8). |
| Principal credentials | Owner client | Never readable by members. |
| Channel tokens (Telegram) | Identity service, via a credential reference | Long-lived. |

#### Soul runtime

| Piece | Domain | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validation, manifest digests, render, admission checks, export, candidate promotion | HQ | Accepted content is immutable to members (0.4 §11). |
| Entry point: front door, member supervision, role routing, recovery ladder | Soul | 0.4 §3: it holds no keys and doesn't decide its own grants. |
| Members (lead, specialists, dream) | Soul, a principal per member in the protected profile | R3 |
| Life (`memorial/`, `dreams/`, `comms/` mirror, `home/<member>/`, `workspaces/`) | Soul root | HQ's store wins wherever authority state diverges. |
| Definition (`SoulInfo.json`, `SoulLock.json`, `primitives/`) | Immutable to members; HQ promotes revisions | R4, 0.4 §10 |

### 3.3 Enforcement profiles (0.4 §4, R8)

| Profile | What it means here | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Managed protected | HQ in its own account. Per-member principals. Broker-only protected egress. Caller-bound grants. Durable receipts. | The Linux reference host first; macOS per-member accounts plus a sandbox second. |
| Managed cooperative | HQ protects keys, but members share a trust domain or have bypass routes | Today's layout, and macOS until it qualifies. Confinement, gh shim and git hooks are cooperative controls. |
| Standalone unenforced | Local stub and local credentials | Development only. `legacy-local-custody` is **off by default** and can be turned on only in this profile. `doctor` and `status` flag it, and every receipt names it. |

Every receipt and the GeniusBar header name the profile actually in force.
A protected claim under a weaker profile is refused with
`profile_insufficient`.

### 3.4 Rules that keep the split honest

1. Plugins import only `@agent-bot/sdk`, never the daemon and never each
   other. A boundary test checks this in each repo.
2. Every cross-plugin need is a named, versioned **host service** or an
   **event**.
3. No contract names a model, provider or harness vendor (R10). Vendors
   appear only in configuration, adapter manifests and evaluation records.
4. soul-runtime `core/` imports none of `node:fs`, `node:child_process`,
   `node:os`, `node:net` or `process.env`.
5. Zero npm dependencies. The SDK and plugins arrive vendored and pinned by
   digest (`governance/plugins.json`), and HQ checks the digests at load.

## 4. Plugin contract (inside HQ)

Plugins are HQ's internal structure. 0.4 doesn't define them, and they add
no trust boundary: every plugin runs in HQ's trust domain. The Soul-side
entry point is a separate process, not a plugin.

### 4.1 Manifest and entry

```js
// plugin.mjs — exactly one default export
import { definePlugin } from '@agent-bot/sdk';

export default definePlugin({
  name: 'agent-bot-comms',          // ^[a-z0-9-]{1,64}$
  version: '0.6.0',                 // the plugin's semver
  hostApi: 1,                       // HQ plugin-API major
  requires: { 'agent-bot-identity': '^1.0.0' },
  optional: { 'agent-bot-soul-runtime': '>=0.1.0 <1' },
  services: ['config', 'store', 'log', 'receipts', 'identityService', 'credentials', 'launch', 'events', 'approvals', 'budgets'],
  identityServiceRoutes: ['/api/daemon/notices*'],   // allowlist for services.identityService
  async init(ctx) { /* register; read-only probes only; return provided services */ },
  async start(ctx) {},
  async stop(ctx, { reason, deadlineMs }) {},
});
```

HQ reads the static fields from `plugin.json` and runs no plugin code until
the set has resolved and every digest matches (§4.5).

### 4.2 What a plugin registers

| Kind | Call | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hq/v1` operations | `ctx.hq.register({ op, auth: 'owner'\|'entry-point', schema, handler })` | Only the operations in 0.4 §5 exist (Hello, Admit, Equip, Ready, Lease, start, stop, pause, resume, drain, sleep, move, fork, accept-revision, rollback-revision, retire), plus owner read views. Plugins implement parts; HQ core owns the dispatch and auth. |
| Broker message kinds | `ctx.broker.registerKind({ kind, schema, consume })` | `directive` (HQ → Soul) and `query` (Soul → HQ) per 0.4 §5, plus plugin queries such as `credential.reference`, `grant.request` and `notices.take`. A peer can't acquire the `directive` kind through its text (T04). |
| Brokered adapters | `ctx.broker.registerAdapter({ id, class: 'inference'\|'service', validate, call, lookup })` | Validates operation type, resource scope, redirects, resolved destination and payload class (0.4 §4). `lookup` supports reconciliation of `unknown` effects. |
| Member surfaces | `ctx.tools.register(tool)`, `ctx.commands.register(cmd)` | MCP tools and CLI commands that members run in the Soul. They resolve to broker queries, never to direct authority. |
| Events | `ctx.events.publish/subscribe(type, payload)` | In process, at most once. Anything durable goes through the store. |
| Readiness probes | `ctx.readiness.register(probe)` | Splits `readiness.mjs` (3.1k lines). |
| Provided services | `return { provides: { … } }` | Dependents receive them as `ctx.deps[name]`. |

There is no remote RPC registration. No component outside the host can
invoke a plugin (R2).

### 4.3 Host services

| Service | Interface (abridged) | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | `get`, `section`: read-only, schema-validated, no secrets | `~/.config/agent-bot/config.json` (HQ account), the plugin's section |
| `store` | `tx(fn)` with plugin-scoped tables, `blob`, `lock` | A transactional embedded database in HQ's account (0.4 §12). Authority tables are separate from mirrors of member-writable state. The plugin `name` is validated before any path is built. |
| `credentials` | `resolve(reference, { task, operation }) → token` (HQ memory only, one operation), `issue(reference)` for Equip | Asks the identity service for a token bound to the device key, the grant, the task and the operation, and never reuses it across operations (§4.7). **A plaintext secret never reaches a member.** If the service is down, the result is `credential_unavailable` (R9); if the device is revoked, `device_revoked`. |
| `identityService` | `call(method, route, body)` | Limited to the allowlist. Hardened per §4.7. |
| `approvals` | `request({ action, digest, scope, reason, cost, expiry })`, `decided(id)` | Produces an HQ-signed approval record from an owner session (0.4 §8). Editing the action invalidates it (T24). |
| `launch` | `member({ soul, role, principal, home, env })`, `track`, `stop` | Per-member principals and private `HOME`/`XDG_*`/`PATH`/temp inside the member's state (0.4 §4). |
| `budgets` | `reserve`, `settle`, `release` | One Soul ceiling with working and maintenance sub-allocations (R5). |
| `receipts`, `log` | `receipts.append(record)`, `log.*` | Receipt fields per 0.4 §7; redacted logs; OTLP with no content and no credentials. |
| `events`, `clock`, `random`, `profile` | as named | `profile.current()` names the enforcement profile. |

### 4.4 Lifecycle and bootstrap order

```text
discover → resolve → load → init (topological order) → start (topological order) → running → stop (reverse order, deadline)
```

- **discover** reads `plugin.json`, validates `name` and checks the
  plugin's digest.
- **resolve** checks semver and `hostApi`, then requires an acyclic
  `requires` graph.
- **`init`** is idempotent. Apart from registering, it may run read-only
  probes (identity asks the signer for device status, for example). It must
  not write authority state, call the identity service or start long-lived
  work. It times out at 10 s.
- **`stop`** gets a deadline.

**Bootstrap, with identity first and hard-required:**

1. **HQ core:** store, control socket (owner sessions), profile detection,
   signer discovery.
2. **identity `init`:** device status from the signer.
   - **Unenrolled** (no device record) → **safe mode**: only `status`,
     `enroll` and `doctor` work, and no Soul is admitted.
   - **Revoked** → the **`device_revoked`** state, which is distinct from
     safe mode and defined in §4.7.
   - **Identity service unreachable** → neither of the above. Admission
     proceeds, and only protected effects that need a fresh credential wait
     with `credential_unavailable` (R9).
3. **identity `start`:** identity-service link (assertion, token, key-set
   check per §4.7), grants, credential references.
4. **comms:** broker (requires identity). It drains identity-service notices
   and connects to configured relays.
5. **soul-runtime:** HQ side (requires identity and comms): validation,
   render, admission handlers.
6. **`hq/v1` admissions open.** Entry points can now send `Hello`.

If a non-identity plugin fails, it is marked `degraded`, its dependents
don't start, and `status` reports why.

### 4.5 Versioning and compatibility

- **Plugin semver** and an integer **`hostApi`** (N and N-1 supported).
- **Wire contracts version on their own** and support N and N-1 with
  explicit capability negotiation (R7): `hq/v1`, broker wire, `task/v1`,
  the 0.4 Appendix A records, the package format, and the identity-service
  signature `agent-bot-sig-v1`. Unknown required semantics are rejected
  (T14).
- **Each HQ release pins one compatible set** in `governance/plugins.json`
  (`name`, `version`, `sha256`). CI refuses a mismatch. **HQ also verifies at
  load:** it hashes each plugin's installed tree (sorted paths, normalised
  modes, the same framing as package digests) and refuses a mismatch with a
  receipt and a `status` reason. A mismatch on identity means safe mode.
  `--dev-plugins PATH` is the only override, and `status` always reports it.
  Pins never move backwards.

### 4.6 Usable on its own for testing

The SDK ships `createTestHost({ plugins, services })` with an in-memory
store, a fake identity service (canned signed responses), a deterministic
clock and random, a fake signer, and fake member principals. Each plugin
repo runs its own tests on it, plus the SDK's **plugin conformance suite**,
which checks:

- idempotent registration;
- repeatable `start`/`stop`;
- `stop` within its deadline;
- no global state;
- no writes outside the store;
- unique names;
- an `auth` class on every `hq/v1` operation.

The 0.4 WP1 fixtures (positive and negative) run against the real plugins.

### 4.7 Identity-service link hardening

These rules apply to every call from HQ to the identity service.
`identity/server-client.mjs` already does the first two; the rest are new.

- **No redirects.** Every fetch uses `redirect: 'error'`.
- **DPoP on every request.** The proof carries `htm`, `htu`, `iat`, a fresh
  `jti` and `ath`, signed by the ephemeral key bound to the token's `jkt`.
  The jwt-bearer assertion that gets the token is signed by the **HQ
  signer's** non-exportable device key.
- **Signed responses are required.** Every response must carry three
  headers:
  - `Agent-Bot-Signature`, an Ed25519 signature over
    `agent-bot-sig-v1\n<status>\n<hex sha256(body)>\n<request jti>`;
  - `Agent-Bot-Request-Jti`, equal to this request's jti;
  - `Agent-Bot-Key-Id`, naming a key in the pinned set.

  Unsigned, unknown or retired `kid`, failed, mismatched or skewed
  (more than 5 minutes) responses are refused before parsing, including
  error responses.
- **Release-pinned keys.** The HQ release ships `server-keys.json`
  (`kid`, `x`, `notBefore`, `notAfter`, `status: active|next|retired`) for
  `agents.true-line.ai`. TOFU is allowed only for a non-default identity
  service named explicitly in config, and is flagged.
- **Rotation.** The `next` key is published at least one release before
  use. An emergency rotation ships as an HQ patch release.
- **Outage.** Tokens already minted are used until expiry and never after.
  An outage widens no authority and gives no component an execution
  channel (0.4 §6).
- **One token per task and operation.** HQ asks for a credential with
  `{ task, operation }`. The identity service records both in the credential
  issuance record, extending 0.4 Appendix A's fields with `task_id` and
  `operation_id`. HQ never reuses a token for another operation: a token is
  held in memory for that operation only and dropped when its action record
  reaches a terminal state. The cost is one mint per protected operation,
  bounded by a per-device rate limit at the identity service.
- **Software device keys.** Until stage 2a a host may still enroll with a
  software key (`key_storage=software`). The identity service can refuse to
  mint for software-key devices **per owner policy**. Once that policy is on,
  those mints are refused with `profile_insufficient`, and the receipt
  names the device's key storage. The device itself is not revoked.
- **`device_revoked`.** When the identity service answers that the device is
  revoked (today `invalid_grant` on `/oauth/token`, or an explicit revoked
  status on any call), HQ maps it to `device_revoked` and does the
  following:
  - it **drops every cached token and resolved credential immediately**,
    without waiting for expiry;
  - it refuses every new credential resolution and every protected external
    effect not yet submitted with `device_revoked`;
  - it moves effects already submitted to reconciliation, as for any
    uncertain outcome;
  - it records a receipt and shows "device revoked: re-enroll" in `status`,
    GeniusBar and the HQ CLI.

  Members see `device_revoked` as the result of their query or task step,
  and the affected tasks wait with reason `credential unavailable` and that
  code. Local conversations, local tasks and operations that need no
  credential continue, so HQ does *not* enter safe mode. Recovery requires a
  **new enrollment** (`enroll --force`) with a fresh device key. The revoked
  device record is never revived. This differs from safe mode's
  "unenrolled" (never enrolled: no Soul admitted) and from
  `credential_unavailable` (transient: retried when the service returns).

### 4.8 Relays, notices and wake

This section replaces the previous "relay RPC" design, which contradicted
R2.

- **Relays are agent-bot-comms in relay mode** (0.4 §6). A site relay ships
  first, then a cloud relay running the same routing code in a restricted
  configuration. `relay.true-line.ai` on a Cloudflare Durable Object is a
  deployment choice that lives in configuration, not in the contract (R10).
- **HQ dials out** to its configured relays over authenticated transport.
  Enrollment uses a node key and an owner-confirmed one-time challenge.
  Relays never get an execution channel.
- **Frames follow the broker wire.**
  - The outer frame carries destination Soul, epoch hint, message ID,
    expiry, size, wake class and required capabilities.
  - The inner message is sealed between endpoint brokers. Relays can't
    decrypt it, extend expiry or change the destination.
  - Public federation stays gated until the crypto profile is reviewed.
- **No remote control.** Relays and the identity service can't start, stop,
  exec or call plugin code. A relay frame that looks like lifecycle never
  reaches the control socket (T12).
- **Wake.** A cloud or site relay delivers to the local broker, which alone
  decides whether to wake a Soul. It checks wake class, wake grant,
  provenance and budget. `external-untrusted` frames never cold-start a
  Soul.
- **Notices (GitHub events from the identity service):**
  - The broker pulls them from the identity service with
    `notices/take`, on a schedule, on reconnect and on demand.
  - Each notice becomes a mailbox message whose message ID is the notice
    ID, with provenance `external-untrusted` and wake class `none` or
    `notify`.
  - The broker **acks the notice only after durable custody in HQ's
    store**. A notice taken twice dedups by message ID, and a crash before
    custody lets the lease expire and the notice return.
  - Delivery is at least once, with one committed transition per message
    ID (T05).
- **Outages.** If the relay is down, local conversations, tasks and
  permitted operations continue and outbound messages queue (R9, T13). If
  the identity service is down, notices wait in its queue (kept 7 days).

## 5. Soul package (0.4 §11, [S4])

### 5.1 Layout

| Path under `Example.soul/Contents/` | Holds | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SoulInfo.json` | Accepted declarations: identity references, host requirements, role assignments and fallback order, approved destinations, budgets | Definition |
| `SoulLock.json` | Resolved digests, target platforms, pinned models (including the embedding model), adapter and renderer versions, rendered-output digest per adapter | Definition |
| `primitives/` | Accepted skills, helper scripts, tool guidance and hooks in harness-neutral form; overrides under `primitives/<name>/adapters/<adapter-id>/` | Definition |
| `opt/` | Pinned runtimes, harness binaries, local models, offline artifacts | Reconstructible |
| `memorial/knowledge/` | Durable assertions with sources | Life |
| `memorial/retrieval/` | Indexing recipe | Life |
| `dreams/inputs/` | Durable notes awaiting consolidation (batched, about 30 s) | Life |
| `dreams/runs/<run-id>/` | Candidate trees and evaluation evidence | Life |
| `comms/` | Mirror of tasks and dedup watermarks, outbox drafts, handoffs | Life (mirror) |
| `home/<member>/` | Each member's private working life, including harness-native state | Life |
| `workspaces/` | Explicitly selected workspace data | Life |
| `cache/retrieval/` | Rebuildable indexes | Rebuilt |
| `host/` | Sockets, PIDs, host bindings | Recreated per host |
| `tmp/` | Scratch | Dropped |

Authoritative grants, spent nonces, key material, task revisions, dedup and
action records live in HQ's store, not in the package. Copying a `.soul`
directory doesn't transfer authority.

### 5.2 Where SOUL.md fits

The persona is a primitive: `primitives/persona/SOUL.md`, of class
"instructions". Its manifest marks it **required, render-first** for every
adapter, so `soul build` places it ahead of the other guidance in each
harness's native file. Because it is a primitive, the rules of 0.4 §10
apply. Only owner acceptance changes it: a dream run can only propose a
candidate. It can't be marked optional for an adapter. The current
`AGENTS.md` becomes `primitives/standing-instructions/`, and the existing
skills become `primitives/<name>/`. Whether to keep the file name `SOUL.md`
is open question Q3.

### 5.3 Digests and manifest

- **The manifest** maps each canonical path to its SHA-256, size and file
  mode. Signed structures use JCS (RFC 8785), as 0.4 §6 proposes.
- **The definition digest** covers exactly the Definition-class entries
  (`SoulInfo.json`, `SoulLock.json`, `primitives/`) and leaves out the
  manifest's own digest field. WP1 fixes the byte rules and publishes vectors.
- **Validation** refuses traversal, absolute paths, symlink escapes,
  archive-expansion overruns, incompatible platforms and dependency cycles
  before activation (T16). Today's `archive-budget.mjs` and format-2 checks
  are the starting point.
- **A digest is not an identity.** The Soul ID is the stable identity
  (R1); a definition digest names one accepted revision.

### 5.4 Moving off formats 1 and 2

`soul.json`, the root `AGENTS.md`, `skills/` and `.soul-state/` are "naming
history" in 0.4 terms, not a second authority.
`agent-bot soul migrate --to contents-1`, an owner operation through
`hq/v1`, converts them:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| `soul.json` | `SoulInfo.json` (declarations) + `SoulLock.json` (resolved pins, including `runtime-pins.json`) |
| `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `bin/` | `primitives/` |
| `.soul-state/space` (Agent Space) | `memorial/knowledge/` |
| `.soul-state/runs` | receipts in HQ's store, plus a `comms/` mirror |
| `.soul-state/runtimes` | `opt/` |
| `worktrees/` | `workspaces/` |
| `revision` / `parentRevision` | Recorded as provenance of the first `contents-1` revision |

Formats 1 and 2 stay readable for one major version, and HQ refuses to
downgrade.

### 5.5 Transfer, backup, template, fork (0.4 §5, §11)

| Operation | Soul ID | Carries | Never carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **move** (life transfer) | Kept | Definition, selected life, plus an authenticated HQ export of operation history (settled watermark, unresolved operations) | Secrets, reusable grants, active leases |
| **backup / restore** | Kept | Selected life, restored only after a new admission | Old grants. They aren't valid after restore; runtime credentials and leases are reissued. |
| **template** | New | Definition plus seed knowledge | Private history, credentials, grants |
| **fork** | New, with parent provenance | Definition plus selected, authorized knowledge | Credentials, live grants, active leases, unsettled side effects |

The first transfer release requires a coordinated drain, settlement,
revocation of old handles, a transfer record and explicit activation on the
destination. There is **one active installation per Soul**: HQ refuses to
activate a copy it has already activated, and the epoch fences commits but
never inbound delivery. Because keys stay at the identity service, a move
needs only re-enrollment of the destination device.

### 5.6 Conformance

0.4's tests govern. The package and runtime gates are T10, T15, T16, T19,
T22 and T27–T30. On top of them, the soul-runtime conformance suite adds the
fixtures that keep the HQ side and the entry point in step, and keep the core
pure so that a hosted runtime remains possible later (D3).

| # | Area | Must hold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Validation vectors | Identical accept/refuse and error codes for shared positive and negative fixtures (stage 0 exit) |
| P2 | Definition digest | Byte-identical digests for the published vectors |
| P3 | Render | Golden output per adapter, persona first; `render_failed` for a non-optional primitive an adapter can't render |
| P4 | Migration | A format-1 or format-2 fixture migrates to `contents-1`, preserving unknown files under `primitives/legacy/` and the revision provenance |
| P5 | Transfer | T15 plus: a move reports missing host requirements, and indexes rebuild from knowledge records |
| P6 | Template and fork | A template excludes private history; a fork records its parent; neither carries grants |
| P7 | Taint | Derived notes inherit source restrictions, and export selection applies them (T19) |
| P8 | Determinism | With clock and random injected, the core produces byte-identical outputs |

## 6. soul-runtime: split and adapter ports

The core is pure, and the HQ side and the entry point implement its ports.
A "hosted" column records what a later server-side runtime would need. That
runtime is outside 0.4's MVP (D3) and is kept possible only by the purity
rule.

```js
createSoulCore({ store, credentials, exec, comms, identity, approvals, clock, random, log })
```

| Port | Interface (abridged) | HQ side / entry point (MVP) | Hosted (post-MVP, not in 0.4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `store` | Definition read and promote (CAS on the parent digest); life get/put/append/list; registry | HQ: package directory plus HQ's store (authority); entry point: life writes in the Soul root, limited by member principals | Per-owner encrypted object store |
| `credentials` | `reference(name, purpose)` → opaque reference | HQ `credentials` service. Members only ever see references. | Identity service directly |
| `exec` | `launch(member)`, `turn(...)`, `cancel`, `workspace.view(task)` | HQ `launch` under per-member principals; entry point drives ACP sessions; workspace views from the task's write scope | Sandbox per turn |
| `comms` | `send`, `inbox`, `ack`, `onDirective`, `query` | Broker socket (comms client in the Soul) | Broker in the hosted environment |
| `identity` | `soulId`, `memberId`, `runtimeId`, `epoch`, `coAuthorTrailer` | Identity plugin through HQ | Same records |
| `approvals` | `request(...)`, `decided(id)` | HQ approval records | The same contract |
| `clock`, `random`, `log` | injected | Host services | Equivalents |

Source modules: Appendix A, `soul-runtime/core`, `/hq` and `/entry-point`.
53 modules are core candidates, and 28 of them still import `node:fs`.

## 7. Owner interface: `hq/v1` for GeniusBar and the HQ CLI

### 7.1 Transport

| Platform | Transport | Who may connect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Linux | `hq/v1` over a Unix domain socket in HQ's state directory | The owner, i.e. the host account that installed HQ (0.4 §4), checked by peer credentials |
| Windows | Named pipe with a DACL for the owner SID | Owner SID |
| Remote / headless | The owner forwards the control socket over SSH (MVP); OAuth or Kerberos authenticators later | Owner, through the tunnel. **Never through a relay** (R2). |
| Browser PWA (optional) | Today's `agent-web` on `127.0.0.1`, with a pairing code from the owner CLI and an HttpOnly cookie | Owner session. It is the only TCP listener, loopback only, and off unless `agent-bot web open` is run. |
| Mobile | Post-MVP, and only through an owner-opened tunnel | Owner |

GeniusBar and the HQ CLI are clients of HQ, not sources of authority.
Every approved operation is available through both (0.4 §3, §8).

### 7.2 Authentication and approvals

- The owner session is the authenticated control-socket peer. HQ records the
  session reference on every approval, grant and lifecycle request.
- An approval is an **HQ-signed record bound to the digest of the proposed
  action**. It names the action or policy change, the resource and data
  destination, why existing authority isn't enough, the expected cost and
  the expiry. Editing the action invalidates it (T24).
- Members, peers, relays and the identity service can't produce an
  approval. A peer saying "the owner approved" stays peer data (T04).
- On the identity service, the owner authenticates with a passkey to unlock
  the vault and confirm device enrollment. The WebAuthn RP ID is
  `agents.true-line.ai`, fixed before passkeys are registered.

### 7.3 Main calls

| Area | `hq/v1` |
| --- | --- |
| Status | `status` (profile in force, plugins and versions, identity-service and relay reachability, degraded reasons) |
| Lifecycle | `start`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`, `drain`, `sleep` (schedule), `move`, `fork`, `accept-revision`, `rollback-revision`, `retire` |
| Authority | `grants.list/create/revoke`, `approvals.list/decide`, `destinations.list/approve`, `budgets.get/set` (ceiling and sub-allocations) |
| Work | `tasks.list/get` (state, waiting reason, evidence), `receipts.query`, `actions.unknown` with `actions.resolve` (owner-resolved outcome) |
| Souls | `souls.list/get` (roles, readiness, unevaluated harnesses), `candidates.list/get` (change list, per-cell matrix, provenance warnings, cost), `evaluations.get` |
| Device | `device.status`, `device.enroll` (starts the identity-service device grant) |
| Events | `events.subscribe` (stream on the same socket) |

Today's `/v0` and `/v1` loopback routes are served by a compatibility layer
until GeniusBar moves. The route-auth test extends to `hq/v1`.

## 8. What happens to the current surfaces

### 8.1 Kept unchanged

The following keep their names, arguments, exit codes and `--json` shapes,
pinned by golden tests (PR 2):

- the `agent-bot` command and its subcommands;
- the `agent-comms` command;
- the hook path `agent-bot hook <name>`;
- bindings and Agent ID records;
- the `QWTS_*` and `AGENT_BOT_*` variables.

Under 0.4 the owner commands talk to HQ over `hq/v1`, and the member
commands talk to the broker. The root-level shims stay for at least two
releases.

### 8.2 Deprecated

| Old | Replacement | Removed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP `take_inbox`, `POST /v0/inbox/take`, `gh-inbox-query`, `inbox-probe` | Broker-pulled notices (§4.8) and a member query `notices.peek` | Two releases after notices ship |
| `gh-app-hook` Worker, `wrangler.toml`, `INBOX_TOKEN`, `WEBHOOK_SECRETS`, `SUBSCRIBERS` | Identity-service webhooks and notices | After a dual-run window |
| Local App key custody: `ensure-private-key`, `identity-app-store`, `soul-credentials`, `credential-reconciler`, keyd App items, `migrate-credentials` | Identity service; HQ credential references | Off by default from PR 18, opt-in only under the standalone profile and flagged by `doctor`/`status`. **Code removed in the HQ release that closes stage 3, proposed no later than 2027-01-31** (planning estimate from 0.4 §13's ranges; the owner confirms the date). |
| `secret*.mjs`, Proton Pass providers, `soul secret set` | Identity-service vault (owner-unlock); HQ credential references | Same switch and the same dated removal as local App key custody |
| `vouch-key.pem`, `/v0/keyd/grant`, keyd `credential`/`git_credential` tools | HQ signer only (soul token `v2`, ES256), or identity-service signing where no hardware signer exists; brokered service adapter | Stage 2a for the key; stage 2b for the tools |
| `device-key.pem` (software) | HQ signer hardware key, after re-enrollment. Until then the identity service may refuse software-key devices per policy. | Stage 2a |
| Owner gate through keyd Touch ID or the admin dialog in an agent account; agent-comms principal credential checks for revisions | HQ approval records from the owner session | Stage 3 |
| One daemon per agent account | One HQ per host in its own account (strangler; the old daemon is retired when HQ passes the same contract and recovery tests) | Stage 3 |
| `soul.json` format 1/2 packages | `contents-1` layout (§5.4) | One major after migration ships |

## 9. Migration plan

Each step is one PR with one objective, mergeable on its own and reversible.
The stages and exits follow 0.4 §13, and each PR names its work package.
Each one follows the SOP (issue first, PR-first, validate before push,
bot-signed commits) and uses `Refs #N` for partial work.

### Stage 0: contract baseline and in-place preparation (WP1)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | daemon | WP1 | **Contracts:** glossary, JSON Schemas for 0.4 Appendix A records, error registry (0.4's minimum codes), positive and negative fixtures, the R1–R12 → tests traceability matrix, and this inventory as the compatibility baseline | Fixtures validate; a schema review finds no vendor token (R10) |
| 2 | identity | WP7 | **Golden surface tests** for every `agent-bot` command, MCP tool and route-auth row | Green on `main` unchanged |
| 3 | identity | WP2 | **Break C1** (inversion; `ownerGate` → approvals port) | The `identity → soul` edge is gone |
| 4 | identity | WP3 | **Break C2, C4, C5** | SCC count down to 2 |
| 5 | identity | WP3 | **Break C3** (`sop.mjs` split, `RevisionStore`) | No cycles |
| 6 | identity | WP1 | **Target and domain columns** in `runtime-modules.json`, plus a test forbidding new plugin → plugin edges | Merged, no runtime change |
| 7 | daemon | WP1 | **SDK v0:** `definePlugin`, host services, `createTestHost`, plugin conformance suite, `wire/` | Pinned, digested copy |
| 8 | identity | WP2 | **Route registry** (generalises `createIdentityRoutes`/`createSoulRoutes`) | `daemon-route-auth.test.mjs` unchanged |
| 9 | identity | WP3 | **MCP and CLI registries** | Golden tests green |
| 10 | identity | WP2 | **Identity-service link split and hardening** (§4.7) | Each refusal tested |
| 11 | identity | WP4 | **Notices pulled with custody-then-ack;** `take_inbox` becomes an alias | T05-style dedup test passes |

### Stage 1: local vertical slice (WP2–WP4)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | daemon | WP2 | **HQ skeleton** in its own account: store, control socket with owner sessions, profile reporting, `hq/v1` Hello/Admit/Equip/Ready/Lease. It **supervises the existing daemon unchanged** (strangler). | HQ reports `managed cooperative` honestly; T14 |
| 13 | comms | WP4 | **Task service in HQ's store** (`task/v1`, CAS, operation keys, proposals versus commitments, write-scope exclusion); directives and queries as broker kinds | T04, T05, T20 |
| 14 | soul-runtime | WP3 | **Entry point** `agent-bot soul run`: ACP front door and terminal chat; lead plus specialist on fake adapters; role routing; handoff notes; recovery ladder | One task completes with scoped proposals and one final commitment |

### Stage 2a: member isolation (WP2)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 | identity | WP2 | **HQ signer:** device key in TPM (Linux) or Secure Enclave (macOS) under the HQ account; soul-token key in the signer (`v2`, ES256), with `vouch-key.pem` removed; re-enrollment path | `key_storage=hardware`; no signing key file on the host; the agent-comms broker verifies soul token `v2`; T02 |
| 16 | daemon | WP2 | **Linux protected profile:** per-member service identities, namespaces, broker socket and workspace views as the only exits, caller-bound grant handles | T01–T03, T21 |

### Stage 2b: brokered adapters (WP2, WP4)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 17 | server | WP2 | **Identity service:** grant-bound minting per task and operation, credential issuance records with `task_id` and `operation_id`, live tokens revoked on device revoke and `device_revoked` on every call afterwards, hardware attestation, an owner policy to refuse software-key devices, device self-revoke, owner-unlock vault | Documented in the server API docs; revocation test shows cached tokens dropped and `device_revoked` |
| 18 | identity | WP2 | **Credential references resolved by HQ;** `legacy-local-custody` off by default and opt-in only under the standalone profile; `doctor` and `status` flag it and any key file | No long-lived secret on a fresh host |
| 19 | comms | WP4 | **Brokered inference and service adapter** (GitHub), action ledger with reconciliation, budgets and sub-allocations | T06–T11, T17–T19, T23, T25, T26 |
| 20 | identity | WP4 | **Retire gh-app-hook** | `doctor` has no `inbox.*` checks |

### Stage 3: operator pilot (WP5, WP6)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 21 | daemon | WP6 | **Owner interface:** `hq/v1` owner operations, approval records, enrollment and receipts in the HQ CLI; GeniusBar moves to `hq/v1` | T24; the pilot rubric runs through terminal chat and ACP only |
| 22 | soul-runtime | WP5 | **`contents-1` package,** validator, `soul migrate`, render per adapter with digests in `SoulLock.json` | T16; P1–P4 |
| 23 | soul-runtime | WP5 | **Dream workflow per 0.4 §10:** dream member, dream grant, staged candidate tree, per-cell evaluation, owner acceptance of the digest | T22, T27–T30 |
| 24 | comms | — | **Rename `agent-comms` → `agent-bot-comms`;** broker, client and relay modes as one plugin package; carry agent-bot's comms modules | Plugin conformance green |
| 25 | identity | — | **Shed host, soul and comms** from agent-bot-identity, leaving the identity plugin and signer | Plugin conformance green |
| 26 | soul-runtime | — | **Carry core, `hq/` and `entry-point/`** into agent-bot-soul-runtime (path-filtered history, re-signed with origin trailers) | P1–P8 green |
| 27 | daemon | WP7 | **First bundled HQ release** (`governance/plugins.json`); Homebrew, GeniusBar and the Linux bundle switch; the old per-account daemon is retired after the contract and recovery suites pass | Golden surface tests green against the release |

### Stage 4: portability and relay (WP4, WP5)

| # | Repo | WP | PR | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 28 | soul-runtime | WP5 | **Coordinated move and fork** with transfer records | T15; P5, P6 |
| 29 | daemon | WP2 | **macOS protected profile** (per-member accounts plus a sandbox; HQ in its own account) | Same hostile-member suite as Linux |
| 30 | comms | WP4 | **Relay mode:** site relay, then cloud relay; reviewed crypto profile | T12, T13 |

**Post-MVP:** the installation authority (partition-tolerant moves), hosted
Souls (D3), mobile owner clients, exposed specialist endpoints, public
federation.

## 10. Decisions, open questions, risks

### 10.1 Top three decisions for Chris

- **D1. agent-bot-daemon is HQ.** 0.4 Appendix C says the HQ role is
  absorbed into managed-machine. This plan puts HQ in agent-bot-daemon,
  which grows out of today's agent-bot daemon, and keeps managed-machine as
  the provisioner (it creates HQ's account and the member accounts).
  Accepting this also means three other updates:
  - 0.4's component table changes;
  - ADR-0645's `qwts/agent-identity` extraction is superseded;
  - ENG-0128 is amended.

  *Recommended: yes.*
- **D2. Provider credentials that can't be short-lived.** 0.4 says a
  long-lived secret never goes on the host, and that inference is brokered
  by HQ. The pilot's primary provider uses static API keys. The options:
  - **(a)** the identity service brokers or issues per-task inference
    credentials;
  - **(b)** use only providers with federated short-lived credentials (such
    as the Bedrock fallback route) for protected work;
  - **(c)** for the pilot, resolve the key into HQ memory only (never
    members, never disk). This is a declared exception named in every
    receipt.

  *Recommended: (c) for the pilot, with (a) as the target.* It needs a line
  in 0.4.
- **D3. Hosted Souls are outside 0.4.** The brief asks for soul-runtime to
  run identically on the server for unmanaged agents. 0.4's MVP is one
  owner on one host, with hosted service gated on tenancy and operations
  work (§15). *Recommended:* keep the pure core and ports (§6) so it stays
  possible, with no server-runtime PRs before the pilot gates.

### 10.2 Open questions

- **Q1. Member accounts on macOS.** ENG-0339 gives one account per
  *harness*, and 0.4 wants one per *member*. Do we extend ENG-0339 or
  replace it?
- **Q2. The HQ account.** What is its name, and is it created by
  managed-machine or by the HQ installer?
- **Q3. The SOUL.md name.** Should the persona primitive keep the file name
  `SOUL.md`?
- **Q4.** Should service writes (signed commits) go only through the
  broker's GitHub adapter in the protected profile, retiring the member-side
  `signed-commit` there?
- **Q5. The agent-watcher model.** 0.4 §12 names true-line's agent-watcher
  model for directives and queries as a WP1 input. Who supplies it?
- **Q6. The browser PWA.** Keep it as an optional owner client, or drop it
  in favour of GeniusBar and the CLI?
- **Q7.** Should the identity service push a "notices waiting" hint through
  a relay, or is the broker's pull enough?
- **Q8. Federation crypto.** Who reviews the profile, and does
  agent-comms' existing federation candidate work feed it?

### 10.3 Risks

| ID | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Hub files: `agent-daemon.mjs` (2.4k lines), `readiness.mjs` (3.1k), `agent-population.mjs` (1.6k, 65 importers), `soul-runtimes.mjs` (1.5k) | Registries first (PRs 8–9) |
| R2 | GitHub installation tokens are 1 h bearer tokens | They stay in HQ memory for brokered adapters only; device revoke revokes live tokens (PR 17) |
| R3 | HQ concentrates authority on the host; the identity service concentrates key custody | 0.4 §4 mitigations: owner-unlock vault, per-owner encryption, issuance records, monitoring, revocation |
| R4 | The Linux protected profile versus first users on macOS | macOS runs cooperative and says so; early macOS qualification (PR 29) |
| R5 | Vendor harnesses may not work under strong enforcement | Adapters qualify one by one; honest route labels (R8) |
| R6 | Two daemons during the strangler period | HQ supervises the old daemon behind explicit interfaces, and the old one is retired only after the shared suites pass |
| R7 | GeniusBar, installed hooks and the Worker load modules by path | Shims for two or more releases; golden tests |
| R8 | The domain move strands enrolled devices (`ServerSession.device()` refuses on a server mismatch) | A signed alias statement from the identity service, with `server enroll --force` as fallback; passkeys only on `agents.true-line.ai` |
| R9 | Windows parity | Windows comes later in 0.4; keep agent-comms' Windows acceptance suite running against the broker |
| R10 | agent-bot-identity is busy | Stage 0 happens in place; each repo split is a single cut |

### 10.4 What changed from the first version of this plan

| First version | Now | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The daemon runs as the agent user and is untrusted | HQ is trusted, in its own account | 0.4 §3, R3 |
| Policy, approvals, vault and soul storage on the server | Approvals, grants, budgets and ledgers in HQ; the server is the identity service only | 0.4 §3, §4, R2 |
| Server → daemon RPC over a Cloudflare relay (review fix) | Removed. Relays are agent-comms relay mode with sealed frames; notices are pulled | R2: relays get no execution channel. The review asked for RPC; this departs from it on 0.4's authority. |
| Leased provider secrets in plaintext in an agent-UID process | Brokered inference in HQ; members get references only (D2 covers static keys) | 0.4 §4, §5 |
| A home-made v3 with `soul.json` + `SOUL.md` + `AGENTS.md` | 0.4 §11 `Contents/` layout; SOUL.md is the persona primitive | [S4] owns the layout |
| A `/v2` UI API with a mobile relay path | `hq/v1` on the control socket; remote only through an owner tunnel | R2, 0.4 §4 |
| Server-side soul-runtime as a deliverable | Post-MVP (D3) | Outside 0.4 scope |
| Our own phases | 0.4 stages 0–4, WP1–WP7, T01–T30 | Shared gates |

## Appendix A. Module inventory and dependency map

Generated from a static scan at the pinned commits. Shims are resolved to
their targets. The **Domain** column uses the 0.4 trust domains: `HQ`,
`Soul`, `HQ + Soul` (shared library or core used on both sides),
`identity service`, `owner client` and `removed`.

Coupling flags are heuristic text matches:

- `fs` is `node:fs`;
- `exec` is `node:child_process`;
- `worktree`, `keyd` and `comms` are mentions;
- `net` is `fetch` or `node:http(s)`/`node:net`;
- `os-secret` is Keychain, pass or DPAPI;
- `key-material` is PEM or key generation.

### A.1 agent-bot-identity runtime modules

Static scan of every non-shim runtime `.mjs` (239 files; 47 one-line re-export shims omitted; tests, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `web/` and `keyd/` excluded).
Columns: **Now** is the ADR-0645 module; **Target** is the destination; **Domain** is the draft 0.4 trust domain the code runs in (§3.2); **Coupling** is a heuristic text scan; **Out/In** is internal imports / importers; **Cross-repo imports** are the edges that must become a host service, an `hq/v1` call or an SDK import; **Cycle** is the strongly connected component from §2.4.
